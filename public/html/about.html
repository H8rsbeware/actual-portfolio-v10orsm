                <p>
                    I would consider myself a logical person, always trying to understand why things are, although I enjoy time spent with animals and outside more than anything.<br>
                    I dont find it easy to write about who I am, sounds pretentious to me, so I thought the best way to do an about page, is to show what made me, me.

                    <h3 class="title-shadow">Before I felt old?</h3>
                    <p>Throughout early school life, I remember myself excelling in science, math, and history. Not as much with reading, I used to go through the 
                        same handful of simple books until I finally figured out the difference between non-fiction and fiction. <br>
                        
                        Before my GCSEs, I was less confident in maths, but I still loved science. The numbers started to confuse me, but the patterns in life, biology
                        especially, is still fascinating to me.<br>
                        
                        For GCSES, i took triple science, history, graphic products, and computer science. I picked triple science for the chemistry and biology, physics
                        to me is just maths by applied, atleast in school. Space has always been incredible to wonder about, but its barely touched on when you are learning
                        "physics". History was a passion pick, Im not amazing with dates, but I love the progression of politics, society, and human understanding, our species
                        has some crazy stories. Computer science I chose because its what I was fairly adequate at, I understood hardware, I knew how the internet worked, and
                        I was learning a few programming languages at the time.

                    <h3 class="title-shadow">Solo sports are best</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've never been one for traditional team sports, while I like teamwork, I prefer to be fully dependable for my success or falls. Im also terrible at anything with a ball, I really
                        have no idea why, my coordination is pretty good but something about an inflated skin just doesnt click. <br><br>

                        Snowboarding is just a win/win of a sport. You get to exercise in the cold which is comfortable, you usually have some padding when you fall over, the views are incredible, and you get to zoom.
                        There really isnt anything as gratifying, no matter what it seems to be a good season. Saying that, its been a while since ive been, not much snow in Falmouth. <br>

                        I wasnt great at Badminton, and then i grew. Safe to say, height is a cheat code in racket sports, and from playing often before COVID-19 I got pretty good, although its another sport Id like to get
                        back into. <br>

                        I also enjoy just exploring, going on long walks, using random outdoor gyms, cycling, and other random activities. They always act as good activities to break up the day and help me relax.

                    <p>Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science... <br><br>

                        Enough of a workload where you want to complain at 16, but the Chem, Bio, Math students wont let you. <br><br>
                        
                        That being said, Biology was something I was pretty good at, I forgoed some of the maths, for more actually knowledge biased questions, the maths that was involved was often quite understandable, as I tied back
                        to graspable concepts. <br>
                        
                        Computer science was kind of a breeze, It was a great class to chill and relearn some old material, learn some new bits, and code. I learnt alot of my web development skills in the same time frame, so it went hand in
                        hand with my NEA, which you can see on the <a class="title" href="./projects.html">project page</a>.<br>
                        
                        Chemistry was where I struggled, visualising and understanding the processes and particles was pretty understandable, but i couldnt then understand some of the more complicated
                        formula, and interactions between the hundreds of thousands of possible molecule combinations. I wish it wasnt half online. <br>
                        
                        All in all, Alevels were a fairly decent period, although the COVID-19 pandemic did take a toll on my education, but I walked a way with a place in Uni, and Alevels in all 3.

                        All pets are just too good for us. Over my life Ive had many pets, from farm animals to felines, they where a huge part of my upbring, and one of the reasons to look forward to going home.
                        I dont really see a life without a Dog though, they are easily an S tier species, always loyal and affectionate which makes them dopimine dispensers. <br><br>

                        My family has spent lots of time on a yard over the years, and while i used to horse ride, my sister is the sibling keeping that tradition alive. But while shes freezing, mucking out over the holidays,
                        I get to sit with my pups, Barkley and Luna, who are an iconic duo. Barkley being a huge labrador who thinks hes about 33% his size, and Luna a shih tzu, who acts like a princess, but only to try and lower your guard to steal your snacks.<br>

                    <p>
                        When it comes to programming, Its been quite a journey. As with most people, my first really exposure to code was in school, learning basic python in computing, however I wanted to make something useful so I started to teach myself. <br>
                        I quickly started learning new languages, trying to find my favourites, but I never really found one. While I love web development, I learnt how to make bots, clis, guis, and productivity tools using pretty much any language requires. A new language
                         never feels new, the syntax is by far the easiest element to pick up but the mindset is transferrable. <br><br>
                        
                        Alot of these projects can be found <a class="title" href="./projects.html">at my project page</a>, although many werent finished, not because I didnt enjoy them, but because I didnt find them challanging enough and wanted to learn more.<br><br>

                        Ive documented that journey more on my <a class="title" href="./portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>, if you'd like to see what I know!

                        The futures like the halting problem, undeteministic, but ideally id like to balance personal projects with the next few years of uni and potential work,
                        building up a portfolio that I can be proud of. Im interested in all fasets of software engineering and while ive done mostly front-end, back-end is a challange id like to pursue. <br>
                        
                        Id like to try writing my own API in the future, however I am currently working on a good collection of projects like a config file maker and obviously this site, but thats the next goal <br><br>

                        I should also be partaking in a industry placement next year which is a huge step in the right direction for a future in this area of expertise.
