#### HCI analysis

###### Questions

1. **From the 6 pages available, which is your favourite**
    - From the 6 options, Projects, Home, and About all got picked
    - This might be cause I updated the quiz as I pushed work to production, meaning some pages werent an option earlier on
    - Contacts is a really simple page, Personal was added much later than the rest, and portfolio was also updated way later than others.

2. **Why? Any improvements?** 
    - The answer that stood out the most was:

    ```
    I think it looks really neat and clean, and describes yourself in the stages, so that I can get a full understanding of who you are.
    Improvements? I would remove the 'see journey' button, just because I think that it is a bit pointlesshaving to click an extra button to view it all, when that is the reason I am viewing the page. 
    If I ammissing a point, I apologise (sorry Oakley).
    Or you could implement this in another way, for examplehaving a brief explanation for each topic, e.g. 
    A levels, and then a button to view more, i.e. a moreexpanded description.
    This way the user can quickly get a just of who you are, and then have theoption to view more in detail if they feel like it.
    ```

    - Despite being there favourite, this respondent offered up some improvements, i.e. removing the drop down due to a lack of content after it. I took that on board so now the journey on the about page is shown by default, and if i want to add content after, i can just add the `about.js` script back.
    - Other answers didnt offer up improvements

3. **How readable is the text? (1-9)**
    - All scores ranged from 7-9.

4. **From the 6 pages available, which is your least favorite?**
    - Here about had 2/3 of the responses, and contact got 1/3

5. **What improvements would you suggest to that page?**

    - One respondent didnt like the lack of chronology on the about page, however this was a choice, as adding dates to work requires me to know that information, and patchy timelines look like a half done job, so while I respect the preference, I dont see a need to alter this page for that reason
    - Another didnt like the length on each about item, saying they need to be shorter, which while I can agree with it to an extent, I currently cant retype parts of it, as I cant really type.
    - Contacts was critisied for a lack of fields, and contents, because of this, I added more fields including first and last name, and added that to my server code. I could also add my socials to this area, and may do in the future.

6. **How easy is it to navigate the site (1-5)**
    - All respondents rated it top score, 5

7. **Do you have any other suggestions or bugs?**
    - One respondent report a bug, involving the navbar not appearing, but on follow up, We found it to be on their end, and it worked upon reinspection
