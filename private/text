Basic

Hi, Im Oakley. A second year at Falmouth University doing a BSc in Computer Science, a dog person, and a self-proclaimed gamer. I spent alot of my mid-late teenage years
learning web development and a variety of programming languages, allowing me to pick the language for the task and not change the task to fit the language. When im not
programming, I enjoy snowboarding, exploring, and watching the stars above; I also spend free time playing a variety of games, inluding Rainbow Six Siege, Factorio, and Terreria.

Education

My Education was mostly defined by the last few years of Secondary school and my Alevels, where I chose Computer Science for both (alongside Chemistry and Biology). I spent alot of my free time self-educating, using the internet to learn anything from random facts to history, geography, and maths, but while most of the time is useful for general knowledge. I often also learnt programming fundementals for a variety of languages, taking on minor projects. While I originally wanted to get into Vetenary medicine, I instead decided to take my hobby and make it into a possible career. 

Ive continued studying Computer Science, picking up several other skills from both Falmouth University, and further experimentation. I selected Artifical intellegence as my optional module to push myself to learn and understand the more technical areas of the subject, although I do not plan to end up in the AI field as a whole.

Hobbies
Exploring and adventure have become a pretty common place in my life, finding myself somewhere completely new and random, and visiting different parts. Its a good break from everyday life and routine, but often helps me come up with new ideas. In the same vien, I enjoy snowboarding, as its takes my full attention and the scenery while boarding is truly a breathetaker. I often find myself being a night owl, spending hours outside at night, watching the world go by and the stars above.
